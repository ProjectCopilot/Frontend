Concierge
=========
A glorified web form with a clean design. Allows users to submit requests to be processed by volunteers.


### Setup
Populate ```.env``` file in project root.
```
PORT=XXXX
HOSTNAME=[0.0.0.0|127.0.0.X|localhost|etc.]
MAILROOM_PORT=XXXX
MAILROOM_HOSTNAME=[0.0.0.0|127.0.0.X|localhost|etc.]
```

Install dependencies.
```
$ npm install
```

Run the app.
```
$ node app.js
```

(Or you can just run `deploy.sh` :wink:)
